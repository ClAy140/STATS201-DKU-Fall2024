# Wind Power Forecasting Using Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project explores the application of **Transfer Learning** to improve wind power forecasting across different regions with varying data characteristics. Traditional wind power forecasting models trained on specific geographic locations often struggle to generalize to other regions due to **climatic variability**, differing **data resolutions**, and the **availability of meteorological features**. This study applies transfer learning to address these issues by training a model on a data-rich region (**China**) and applying it to a data-scarce region (**U.S.**), significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy.

## Key Concepts
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging knowledge from one region (e.g., China) to improve forecasting in another region (e.g., U.S.) with limited data.
- **Climatic Variability**: Differences in weather patterns, such as wind speed and temperature, which affect wind power generation and forecasting accuracy.
- **LSTM Networks**: A type of **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** used for time-series forecasting, well-suited for capturing long-term dependencies in wind power data.

```

5. You can visualize the results in the `output_plots/` folder. 

## Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the transfer learning model compared to traditional region-specific models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **transfer learning** can be applied to improve **wind power forecasting** across regions with varying data availability. By leveraging high-resolution datasets from regions like **China**, we can significantly enhance forecasting accuracy for **data-scarce regions** like the **U.S.**, leading to improved **grid stability** and supporting **decarbonization** efforts.
