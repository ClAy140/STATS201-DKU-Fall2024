## Overview  

This project investigates how **Transfer Learning (TL)** can improve **wind power forecasting** across regions with different data characteristics. Conventional forecasting models struggle to generalize due to climatic variability, data resolution differences, and the availability of meteorological features.  
Our solution trains a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model on data from a **feature-rich region (China)** and transfers the learned knowledge to improve predictions in a **feature-poor region (U.S.)**.  

### **Key Achievements**  
- Enhanced accuracy in forecasting for **data-scarce regions**.  
- Demonstrated the value of **transfer learning** for renewable energy applications.  
- Supported improved **grid stability** and **decarbonization efforts**.

## Key Concepts  

### Transfer Learning  
Applies knowledge from a data-rich region (**China**) to enhance forecasting in a data-scarce region (**U.S.**).  

### Climatic Variability  
The effects of regional weather differences (e.g., wind speed, temperature) on model generalizability.  

### LSTM Networks  
A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** that captures long-term dependencies in **time-series forecasting**.
